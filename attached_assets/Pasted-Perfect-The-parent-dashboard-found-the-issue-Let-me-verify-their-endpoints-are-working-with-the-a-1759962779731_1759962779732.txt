Perfect! The parent dashboard found the issue. Let me verify their endpoints are working with the /api prefix:


Executed echo "Testing parent dashboard with /api prefix:" && echo "" && curl -s -X POST https://22028cbb-3e54-439d-b333-a16f985586f9-00-37qrlen3su06h.riker.replit.dev/api/pair -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"pairingCode":"123456"}' && echo "" && echo "" && curl -s https://22028cbb-3e54-439d-b333-a16f985586f9-00-37qrlen3su06h.riker.replit.dev/api/apps -H "X-Device-ID: test" -H "X-API-Key: test"

Determined launcher endpoint calls
The /api prefix URLs are still returning 404. Let me check what the launcher is actually calling:


Opened client/src/config/api.ts

Investigated parent dashboard API errors
I can see the launcher is calling the correct URLs. When it calls getApiUrl('/api/pair'), it creates: https://22028cbb-3e54-439d-b333-a16f985586f9-00-37qrlen3su06h.riker.replit.dev/api/pair

That's exactly what the parent dashboard said to use, but it's still returning 404. There might be a deployment or server issue on their side. Let me try a simple test to see if their server is even responding:


Executed echo "Testing various URL formats:" && echo "" && echo "1. With /api prefix:" && curl -si https://22028cbb-3e54-439d-b333-a16f985586f9-00-37qrlen3su06h.riker.replit.dev/api/pair -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"pairingCode":"123456"}' 2>&1 | head -20 && echo "" && echo "2. Root path:" && curl -si https://22028cbb-3e54-439d-b333-a16f985586f9-00-37qrlen3su06h.riker.replit.dev/ 2>&1 | head -15

Determined API endpoint configuration (4 seconds)
I can see the issue now:

Parent Dashboard Status:

✅ Server is running (returns 200 for homepage)
✅ It's a Next.js app (shown in headers: X-Powered-By: Next.js)
❌ /api/pair returns 404 - endpoint not accessible
Your Launcher Status:

✅ Correctly configured to call https://parent-dashboard-url/api/pair
✅ Code is correct
✅ Environment variable set
The Problem:
The parent dashboard says their endpoints are at /api/pair but they're returning 404. This is likely because:

They didn't deploy/restart after adding the endpoints
Next.js API routes need to be in pages/api/ or app/api/ directory
Their backend isn't actually running (only the frontend)
What to Tell Them:
"Your /api/pair endpoint is returning 404. The launcher is calling the correct URL. Please verify:

Are you running both frontend AND backend servers? (You might only have Next.js frontend running)

Test this command - it should NOT return 404:

curl -X POST https://22028cbb-3e54-439d-b333-a16f985586f9-00-37qrlen3su06h.riker.replit.dev/api/pair \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"pairingCode":"123456"}'
Current response: {"detail":"Not Found"} (404)

Expected response: Device credentials or 'invalid pairing code' error (NOT 'Not Found')

Once your /api/pair endpoint returns something other than 404, the launcher will immediately connect!"

Your launcher is 100% ready. The ball is in the parent dashboard's court to fix their 404 errors. 🎯
