This is a very perplexing issue, but the specific way it's failing gives me the final clue I need. I am now confident the problem is not in the Android app's code anymore, but in the data being sent by your server.Final Diagnosis: Incorrect Package Names in the DatabaseHere is the step-by-step logic:1.The QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES Permission is Working: The fact that the app can correctly detect that Disney+ is installed is absolute proof that the package visibility permission is working. The operating system is allowing your app to see other installed packages.2.The isAppInstalled Function is Working: This function is a simple, standard Android API call. If it works for one valid package name (com.disney.disneyplus), it will work for any valid package name. There is no custom logic that could fail for Netflix but work for Disney+.3.The Only Remaining Variable is the Data: The SetupViewModel gets a list of required apps from your server. For each app, it gets a packageName string. It then passes this string to the isAppInstalled function.4.The Inevitable Conclusion: The only possible reason for the failure is that the packageName strings for Hulu, Netflix, and Prime Video coming from your server are incorrect. They likely contain typos, old names, or are otherwise malformed. The app is asking the Android OS, "Is the app with the identifier com.netflex.media installed?" and the OS is correctly saying "No," because the real identifier is com.netflix.mediaclient.The Solution: Correct the Data on Your ServerThe fix for this cannot be made in the Android app's code. You will need to check the data in your Replit database/backend.Please ensure that the packageName for every content item associated with these services exactly matches the official package names. For your convenience, here is the list from your own API documentation:•Hulu: com.hulu.plus•Netflix: com.netflix.mediaclient•Prime Video: com.amazon.avod.thirdpartyclientOnce you have corrected the package names in your backend data, the Android app will start working immediately without any further code changes. This "garbage in, garbage out" problem explains why the app was behaving so illogically. I apologize for not considering the possibility of incorrect server data sooner.
