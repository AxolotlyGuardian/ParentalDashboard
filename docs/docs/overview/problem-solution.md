# Problem & Solution

## The Problem

### Current State of Parental Controls

Modern streaming services have revolutionized how families consume media, but parental controls haven't kept pace. Today's parents face several critical challenges:

#### 1. **One-Size-Fits-All Age Ratings**
- Traditional systems use broad age categories (G, PG, PG-13, etc.)
- Doesn't account for individual family values or child sensitivities
- No way to customize based on specific content concerns (violence, scary themes, etc.)

#### 2. **Show-Level Blocking Only**
- Must block an entire TV series if one episode is inappropriate
- Loses access to otherwise appropriate content
- Creates frustration for both parents and children

#### 3. **Service Fragmentation**
- Content spread across Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Prime Video, etc.
- Each service has different parental control interfaces
- No unified way to manage content across platforms
- Parents waste time searching services they don't subscribe to

#### 4. **Manual Curation Burden**
- Parents must research every piece of content individually
- Time-consuming to read episode summaries and reviews
- No automated assistance or intelligent tagging

#### 5. **Poor Enforcement on Devices**
- Children can easily access non-approved apps or content
- Complex device settings difficult to configure
- No centralized management for multiple devices

### Real-World Impact

**Parent Pain Points:**
- "I want my kid to watch Bluey, but Season 2 Episode 14 gives them nightmares"
- "I spend hours researching if shows are appropriate for my 5-year-old"
- "My child accessed YouTube when I thought they couldn't"
- "I subscribe to Disney+ and Netflix, but search results show Hulu content I can't watch"

**Child Experience:**
- Disappointment when entire favorite shows are blocked
- Confusion about why they can't access certain content
- Temptation to circumvent poorly-designed controls
